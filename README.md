# Handlebars.js Resources plug-in for Grails

This plug-in supports using [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates with the Grails [Resources Plugin](http://www.grails.org/plugin/resources).
This plugin includes a resource mapper that will precompile the template files into JavaScript and make it available for other resource processing,
including minification and bundling. The Handlebars.js resource files are also included.
